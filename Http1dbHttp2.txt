HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol for transferring data over the web. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and is used to request and transmit web pages, images, videos, and other resources between web servers and web clients, such as browsers or mobile applications.

HTTP is a client-server protocol, which means that it involves communication between a client (such as a web browser or mobile app) and a server (which hosts the website or web application). The client sends an HTTP request to the server, which then sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response contains the requested data or resource, such as a web page, image, or video.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request and response is independent and does not rely on any previous messages. This makes the protocol simpler and more scalable, but it can also lead to performance issues.

Here are some of the key differences between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP/2:

Multiplexing: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, while HTTP 1.1 only allows one request and response to be sent at a time. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections and improves the performance of the protocol.

Binary protocol: HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol instead of the text-based protocol used in HTTP 1.1. This reduces the size of the data transmitted between the client and server, improving the efficiency of the protocol.

Header compression: HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the size of header data, which can be significant in HTTP 1.1. This also helps to improve the efficiency of the protocol and reduce latency.

Server push: HTTP/2 allows the server to send multiple responses to a single request, which can improve the speed and efficiency of web applications.

Prioritization: HTTP/2 allows the client to specify the priority of requests, which can improve the responsiveness of the protocol and reduce latency. In HTTP 1.1, all requests are treated equally.

TLS encryption: While HTTPS is optional in HTTP 1.1, it is mandatory in HTTP/2.

Overall, HTTP/2 offers significant performance improvements over HTTP 1.1, particularly for complex web applications that require multiple requests and responses. However, not all web servers and browsers support HTTP/2, and some older applications may not be compatible with the new protocol.
